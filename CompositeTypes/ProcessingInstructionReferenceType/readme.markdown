A reference to a General or Generation Instruction that was used by the parent object, e.g. an instruction used to derive a Variable or used by a ProcessingEvent. The basic Reference structure is extended to allow for the use of Binding to link specific source parameters to the InParameter of the instruction at the point of use. If there is a conflict between a Binding in the iinstruction of a specific source to an InParameter and the Binding information provided in the ProcessingInstructionReference, the Binding information in the reference overrides that found in the instruction. TypeOfObject should be set to ProcessingInstruction.
