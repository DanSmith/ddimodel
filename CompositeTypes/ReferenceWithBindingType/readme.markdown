A reference to an object containing a Binding, e.g. a GeneralInstruction, GenerationInstruction, ControlConstruct, etc. The basic Reference structure is extended to allow for the use of Binding to link specific OutParameters and InParameter at the point of use. If there is a conflict between a Binding in the reference and the Binding information provided in the object of the reference, the Binding information in the reference overrides that found in the object of the reference.
