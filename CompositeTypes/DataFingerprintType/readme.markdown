Allows for assigning a hash value (digital fingerprint) to the data or data file. Set the attribute flag to "data" when the hash value provides a digital fingerprint to the data contained in the file regardless of the storage format (ASCII, SAS, binary, etc.). One approach to compute a data fingerprint is the Universal Numerical Fingerprint (UNF). Set the attribute flag to "dataFile" if the digital fingerprint is only for the data file in its current storage format.
