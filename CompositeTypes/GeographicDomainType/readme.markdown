Structures the response domain for a geographic point to ensure collection of relevant information. The point may be associated with a polygon (such as the centroid of the polygon) or a line (end or shape points of a line). Note that the common response domain objects (OutParameter, ResponseCardinality, and ContentDateOffset) are available at each of the response objects in the representation.
