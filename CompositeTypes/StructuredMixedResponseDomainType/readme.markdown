A structure to allow for mixing multiple response domains in a single question. These may also include intervening text statements that are tightly bound to a response domain. A common example is the use of a CodeDomain and a TextDomain where the TextDomain is associated with the value with the label "Other" in the CodeDomain. ResponseDomains should be chosen that do NOT duplicate responses such as CodeLists with overlapping codes. Be aware that certain instruments may collect responses in such a way that confusion between a code response and text response may be possible. The process of resolving such conflicts should be addressed in the data processing instructions. There is an assumption that if a text or numeric response duplicates a coded response to a question, that the value is that of the coded category. At least one ResponseDomain must be provided.
