Structures the representation for a geographic point to ensure collection of relevant information using a single response domain structure. The point may be associated with a polygon (such as the centroid of the polygon) or a line (end or shape points of a line). The structure provides a description of the default values for the datum type, coordinate system used, the coordinate zone, error correction method, standard offset, the geographic object being positioned, the type of address match if used, the point format, and spatial primitive type. It provides response options for the coordinate pairs being captured, and alternate values for the offset, geo-referenced object and coordinate system if a different one is used to capture a specific response.
