SplitCondition,StructuredStringType,0,1,Condition for using this stage. Use only when multiple top level stages are used.,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
FrameRequirements,StructuredStringType,0,1,"Describes the minimum requirements of the frame needed to use this sample stage. For example, if a stratification by age is specified in the stage the sample frame would need to support this stratification.",,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
RecommendedFrameReference,SampleFrame,0,n,Identifies a specific sample frame or frames appropriate for this plan.,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
Stratification,StratificationType,0,n,Describe all stratifications here. Note that each stratified group will be sampled using the same sampling plan. For example stratifying a state by ZIP Code areas in each of 5 mean income quintiles and then doing a random sample of the households in set of ZIP Codes. Allows for oversampling of identified subpopulations.,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
SamplingUnit,CodeValueType,0,1,Sampling unit for this stage,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
TypeOfPlan,CodeValueType,0,1,Indicate PlanCode if different from parent. Note that all strata resulting from the stratification process must use the same sampling plan.,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
SelectionProbability,StructuredStringType,0,1,"If known and available, provide the selection probability for each sampling unit.  This is one number for equal probability sampling, such as SRS.  For PPS, a description of the size criterion is needed.  For other unequal designs, a description of of how the probabilities are assigned is needed.",,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
SubStage,SubStageType,0,n,A substage assumes that its sample frame is the result of its parent stage.,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
