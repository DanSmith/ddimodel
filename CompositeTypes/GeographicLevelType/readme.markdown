Describes a level within the GeographicStructure. In addition to a name and description, provides one or more GeographicLevelCodes by which it is identified with specified system, any coverage limitations, and parent position within a single hierarchy or if it is the result of layering multiple hierarchies, the lowest component level for each of the layering hierarchies. Allows for an indicator declaring that coverage of the parent level is or is not exhaustive.
