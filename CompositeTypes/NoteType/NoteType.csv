ProprietaryInfo,ProprietaryInfoType,0,1,"A set of actions related to the object as described by a set of name-value pairs. This would commonly be used in a case where additional information needs to be recorded regarding the content of a new element or attribute that has not yet been added to the schema, for example when a bug for a missing object has been filed and the user wishes to record the content prior to correction in the schema. Ideally this should be handled by local extensions of the schema as described in Part 2 of the formal documentation. However, the structure in Note allows for an unanticipated need for an extension at run time by providing a means of capturing system specific information in a structured way.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
