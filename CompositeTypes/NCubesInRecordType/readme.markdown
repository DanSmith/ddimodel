Identifies the NCubes and any variables in the record external to NCube structures such as case identification variables that are contained in the logical record by indicating that all NCubes contained in the logical product are included, inclusion of a NCubeScheme to include, or listing individual NCubes to include. When the attribute allNCubesInLogicalProduct is set to "false" use the NCubeSchemeReference (which allows for exclusions) and NCubeReference to specify the included variables. A nested VariablesInRecord structure is used to include non-NCube variables in the record.
