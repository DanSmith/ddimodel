Describe all stratifications here. Note that each stratified group will be sampled using the same sampling plan. For example stratifying a state by ZIP Code areas in each of 5 mean income quintiles and then doing a random sample of the households in set of ZIP Codes. Allows for oversampling of identified subpopulations. Example: urban/rural, gender, state, marital status. Might be defined at the SamplngScheme level.
