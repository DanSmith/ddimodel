A structure that links a unique value of a code to a specified category and provides information as to the location of the code within a hierarchy, whether it is discrete, represents a total for the CodeList contents, and if its sub-elements represent a comprehensive coverage of the code. The Code is identifiable, but the value within the code must also be unique within the CodeList.
