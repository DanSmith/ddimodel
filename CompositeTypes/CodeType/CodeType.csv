Value,ValueType,0,1,"The value of the code. In a microdata file this would be the value found in the data file. If used as the description of an NCube dimension the value provides the coordinate value for that dimension. Note that r:Value has an attribute xml:space with the default value of ""default"". If white space is critical to the understanding of this code value (such as critical leading or tailing spaces, or multiple spaces within the code) change the value of xml:space to ""preserve"".",,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
