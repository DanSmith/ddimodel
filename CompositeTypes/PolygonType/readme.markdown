A closed plane figure bounded by three or more line segments, representing a geographic area. Contains either the URI of the file containing the polygon, a specific link code for the shape within the file, and a file format, or a minimum of 4 points to describe the polygon in-line. Note that the first and last point must be identical in order to close the polygon. A triangle has 4 points. A geographic time designating the time period that the shape is valid should be included. If the date range is unknown use a SingleDate indicating a date that the shape was known to be valid.
