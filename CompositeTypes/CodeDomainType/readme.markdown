A response domain capturing a coded response (where both codes and their related category value are displayed) for a question. Includes standard response domain elements; OutParameter, designation of response cardinality, and a declaration of an offset date for the data content. Contains the equivalent content of a CodeRepresentation including a reference to the CodeList used and the ability to limit the use of the CodeList to specific CodeList levels, ranges, or values. Adds a set of elements available to all Response Domains; Label, Description, OutParameter, designation of response cardinality, and a declaration of an offset date for the data content. CodeDomains cannot be included by reference. CodeDomain does not have an equivalent managed representation as the CodeList itself is a managed object. CodeDomains must be entered in-line.
