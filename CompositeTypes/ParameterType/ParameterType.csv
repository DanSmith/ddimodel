ParameterName,NameType,0,n,"A name for the Parameter. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.",,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_2,e,
Alias,string,0,1,If the content of the parameter is being used in a generic set of code as an alias for the value of an object in a formula (for example source code for a statistical program) enter that name here. This provides a link from the identified parameter to the alias in the code.,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_2,e,
Description,StructuredStringType,0,1,A description of the Parameter. May be expressed in multiple languages and supports the use of structured content.,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_2,e,
ValueRepresentation,RepresentationType,0,1,"If the content of the parameter contains representational content, such as codes, provide the representation here. ValueRepresentation is the abstract head of a substitution group and may be replaced with any valid substitution for ValueRepresentation. Inclusion of the ValueRepresentation is recommended if you will be sharing data with others as it provides information on the structure of what they can expect to receive when the parameter is processed.",,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_2,e,
ValueRepresentationReference,RepresentationReferenceType,0,1,Allows for the use of a ManagedRepresentation by reference. ValueRepresentationReference is the abstract head of a substitution group and may be replaced with any valid substitution for ValueRepresentationReference.,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_2,e,
DefaultValue,ValueType,0,1,Provides a default value for the parameter if there is no value provided by the object it is bound to or the process that was intended to produce a value.,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_2,e,
IsArray,boolean,0,1,"If set to ""true"" indicates that the content of the parameter is a delimited array rather than a single object and should be processed as such.",,,,,,,,,,a,
