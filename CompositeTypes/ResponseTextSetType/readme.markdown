Provides a means of bundling multiple language versions of the same intended dynamic text together. This wrapper serves to differentiate between a case where multiple language content for a single ResponseText are provided and when two differing sets of ResponseText are in immediate sequence (with no intervening question). Each of the repetitions of ResponseText within this wrapper are assumed to be multi-language equivalents.
