MaintainableObject,MaintainableObjectType,0,1,"Do not use if the referenced object is Maintainable. For references to Identifiable and Versionable objects this provides contextual information on the Maintainable Parent of this object at point of origin. Note that if the ID, Agency, Version sequence is used, and the scope of uniqueness of the referenced object is the Maintainable, then the ID of the Maintainable is needed to create the structured ID portion of the canonical URN. If the system uses the deprecated URN, both the Maintainable ID and TypeOfMaintainableObject are required to create the deprecated URN structure.",,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
UserAttributePair,StandardKeyValuePairType,0,n,A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended.,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
IsExternal,boolean,0,1,"Indicates that the reference is made to an external source. If the value is true, then a URI must be provided.",,,,,,,,,,a,
ExternalReferenceDefaultURI,anyURI,0,1,"URI identifying the location of an external reference as provided in the maintainable object of the referenced item. For example the content of the externalReferenceDefaultURI of the parent VariableScheme for a referenced Variable.

IsReference,boolean,0,1,A fixed attribute value identifying which elements are references.,,,,,,,,,,a,
LateBound,boolean,0,1,"The default value is set to false indicating that the reference is to a specific version of the object.

LateBoundRestriction,string,0,1,"Use when lateBound is changed to ""true"". The specifies the point to begin late binding the version number. For example if an object had a two part version number such as X.Y where X is a major version and Y a minor version and the request is for the latest minor version of major version number 4, the content of this field would be 4. Indicating lateBound and not providing information for this field indicates the request is for the latest version available without restriction.",,,,[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)*,,,,,,a,
ObjectLanguage,language,0,n,Specifies the language (or language-locale pair) to use for display in references to objects which have multiple languages available.,,,,,,,,,,a,
SourceContext,anyURI,0,1,Provide a DDI URN for the version of the parent maintainable that shows the full context for the referenced object. This is used only when the context of the object within the current version of a maintainable is important to the user and this version is later than the one containing the object itself. For example a occupation classification may be unchanged since version 1.0 of its maintainable but at the point of reference the current version of the maintainable containing the original structure is at version 2.0 etc..,,,,,,,,,,a,
