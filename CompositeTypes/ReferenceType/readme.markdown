Used for referencing an identified entity expressed in DDI XML, either by a URN and/or an identification sequence. If both are supplied, the URN takes precedence. At a minimum, one or the other is required. If the identification sequence is used the content of MaintainableObject may be required to be able to assemble the canonical or deprecated DDI URN. To fully support interoperability both the DDI URN and the full identification sequence should be used. Note that to support interoperability of the canonical and deprecated URN, at minimum the MaintainableIdentifier and TypeOfMaintainableObject should be supplied if the canonical URN is being used for the reference. The lateBound attribute has a boolean value, which - if set to true - indicates that the latest version should be used. Use the attribute lateBoundRestriction to indicate when a portion, such as the major version number, should be restricted to a specific value and then late bound within that restriction. Element descriptions will contain a list of applicable TypeOfObject values.
