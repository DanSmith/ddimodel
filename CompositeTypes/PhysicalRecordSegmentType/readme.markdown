A description of the physical record segment as found in the data store. A logical record may be stored in one or more segments housed hierarchically in a single file or in separate data files. All logical records have at least one segment. Identifies the Key variable identifying the segment if the identifier exists in the record, a file name identifier if the segment identification is expressed as part of the file name (used when each segment is stored in a separate file), the order of this segment in relation to other physical segments as part of the logical record, and a flag indicating whether or not the physical segment contains a key.
