A Unit Type is a class of objects of interest. A Unit Type is used to describe a class or group of Units based on a single characteristic with no specification of time and geography. For example, the Unit Type of "Person" groups together a set of Units based on the characteristic that they are "Persons". It concerns not only Unit Types used in dissemination, but anywhere in the statistical process. For example, using administrative data might involve the use of a fiscal unit. [GSIM 1.1]
