Citation,CitationType,0,1,A citation for the physical instance of a data set. Note that a DOI or similar unique identifier for the data file should be placed in InternationalIdentifier. It is strongly recommended that use of a Citation in this location includes the use of the optional sub-element Title.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
DataFingerprint,DataFingerprintType,0,n,"Allows for assigning a hash value (digital fingerprint) to the data or data file. Set the attribute flag to ""data"" when the hash value provides a digital fingerprint to the data contained in the file regardless of the storage format (ASCII, SAS, binary, etc.). One approach to compute a data fingerprint is the Universal Numerical Fingerprint (UNF). Set the attribute flag to ""dataFile"" if the digital fingerprint is only for the data file in its current storage format.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:physicalinstance:3_3,e,
Coverage,CoverageType,0,1,"Includes information about the topical, spatial, and temporal coverage of the physical instance. May be expressed as a restriction of the parent study coverage.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
DataRelationshipReference,DataRelationship,0,n,"Reference to the DataRelationship containing the LogicalRecord to which the RecordLayout refers. Repeat for cases where LogicalRecords are described in multiple DataRelationship structures. Note that this does not imply that all of the LogicalRecords described in the DataRelationship are contained, wholly or in part in the PhysicalInstance. This reference allows for a direct path between the PhysicalInstance and the related content found in a LogicalProduct.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
RecordLayoutReference,RecordLayout,0,n,References the record layout of the data documented in the physical instance.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
DefaultMissingValuesReference,ManagedMissingValuesRepresentation,0,1,References the content of the default missing values used in the file. The content of this file overrides default missing value information provided in the LogicalRecord. Allows for the specification that is a Systems Missing Value.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:physicalinstance:3_3,e,
DataFileIdentification,DataFileIdentificationType,0,n,Identifies the data file documented in the physical instance and provides information about its location.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:physicalinstance:3_3,e,
DataFileVersion,DataFileVersionType,0,1,"Provides the version information for the data file related to this physical instance. Note that while Physical Instance allows for multiple copies of the same data file (such as backup copies) the assumption is that they are identical in terms of content, layout, format and version.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:physicalinstance:3_3,e,
QualityStatementReference,QualityStatement,0,n,"A reference to a Quality Statement pertaining to the quality of the study methodology, metadata, or data to which it is associated. Quality statements may be related to external quality standards.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
GrossFileStructure,GrossFileStructureType,0,1,"Includes information about the file structure, as well as other characteristics that are specific to the physical instance.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:physicalinstance:3_3,e,
ProprietaryInfo,ProprietaryInfoType,0,1,Contains information proprietary to the software package which produced the data file. This is expressed as a set of name-value pairs. The value may be taken from a controlled vocabulary.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
StatisticalSummary,StatisticalSummaryType,0,1,"Includes variable and category statistics data documented in the physical instance, or a reference to a physical instance where the statistics are described or located in line.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:physicalinstance:3_3,e,
ByteOrder,CodeValueType,0,1,Contains a term from a controlled vocabulary indicating the byte ordering.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:physicalinstance:3_3,e,
