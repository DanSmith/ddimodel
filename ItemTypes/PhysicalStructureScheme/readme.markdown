A scheme containing a set of PhysicalStructures containing descriptions of overall structure of a physical data storage format. These descriptions provide the primary link to the LogicalRecord found in the data file, general structural information such as use of proprietary storage structures, division of logical records into physical segment, and default values for decimal separators, etc. Each description can apply to one or more data files containing the same logical records in the same overall structure. In addition to the standard name, label, and description, it allows for inclusion of an existing PhysicalStructureScheme by reference, and PhysicalStructure or PhysicalStructureGroup descriptions in-line or by reference.
