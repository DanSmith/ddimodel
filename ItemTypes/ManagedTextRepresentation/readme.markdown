Means of describing text based content used by reference to define Variable Representation and Question Response Domain. Text Representations cover all non-code and non-category representations/response domains that should be treated or analyzed as characters regardless of whether the character is a number or a letter. In addition to the name, label, and description, the scheme defines the maximum and minimum length of the allowed text and allows for the use of a regular expression to further define the valid content.
