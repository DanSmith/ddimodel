Means of describing the Missing Values within a managed representation so that they can be reused by multiple variables and questions. Variable has a separate Missing Values location for this representation. Questions must use a StructuredMixedResponseDomain to include both standard response and Missing Value responses in a single question. In addition to the name, label, and description of the representation, the structure defines the type of the missing values, a optional generation instruction for deriving the value to be recorded, and the ability to define a blank as a missing value.
