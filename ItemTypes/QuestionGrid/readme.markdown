Structures the QuestionGrid as an NCube-like structure providing dimension information, labeling options, and response domains attached to one or more cells within the grid. Provides the intent of the QuestionGrid, input and output parameters for the grid, the question text for the grid, details on the dimensions, allowed responses, and additional cell contents of the grid, references to external aids and instructions, and an estimate of the time required to complete the grid. Note that the QuestionGrid is a reusable format for use in any number of applied uses. External aids, instructions, response sequencing etc. should contain information consistent with the general use of the QuestionGrid. Additional materials and information can be added within the QuestionConstruct which is the applied use of a question.
