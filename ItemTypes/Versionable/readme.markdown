Adds the attribute identifying this as a versionable object as well as the MaintainableObject. All versionable objects should provide their contextual information, the identity of their maintainable parent. The deprecated form of the URN contains all the information to identify and object and its context. A Canonical URN scoped to the Maintainable contains the ID of the Maintainable as part of its structure. To provide full contextual information use the MaintainableObject structure. The use of the Canonical URN scoped to the agency or the identification sequence alone requires the content of the MaintainableObject to provide full contextual information. All content of Versionable is considered to be administrative metadata. Note that changes to the administrative metadata does not drive a change in the version of the parent objects. See DDI 3.2 Technical Documentation: Part I for further details.
