This is an abstract structure which serves as a substitution base for current and future LogicalProduct definitions relating to specific data types. Used as an extension base for all other LogicalProducts within its substitution group, it ensures that all DDI LogicalProduct descriptions will contain a consistent means of linking a physical data file to its logical (intellectual) description via the LogicalRecord found in DataRelationship. The extension base includes the standard name, label, and description, coverage information, a structure to define data relationships (identifies each logical record and the relationship(s) between them), as well as OtherMaterial related to its contents.
