UniverseReference,Universe,0,1,"Reference to the universe statement from the universe scheme, describing the ResourcePackage of persons or other elements that are the object of research and to which any analytic results refer. Age, nationality, and residence commonly help to delineate a given universe, but any of a number of factors may be involved, such as sex, race, income, veteran status, criminal convictions, etc. The universe may consist of elements other than persons, such as housing units, court cases, deaths, countries, etc. In general, it should be possible to tell from the description of the universe whether a given individual or element (hypothetical or real) is a member of the population under ResourcePackage. A universe may be described as ""inclusive"" or ""exclusive"". This ResourcePackage level reference is normally to the top level of the UniverseScheme.",,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_2,e,
