An NCube is a 1..n dimension structure which relates a set of individual values to each other by defining them within a matrix. The NCube may be the result of aggregations, cross-tabulation, time-series, etc. The NCube is described by its dimensions which are represented by categorical variables (variables with a set number of values of specific definition that can be used to identify a specific cell as part of a matrix address). The resulting cells can contain one or more measures, also defined by variables. In addition to the standard name, label, and description of the NCube, it contains a reference to a universe, defines both the normal source of the data in the cells and unit of analysis, the purpose of creating the structured data, the dimensions and measures, as well as the ability to attached any other attribute (i.e., footnote, cell or region specific note) to a specified area of the NCube. Three attribute serve as informational check values; dimensionCount, cellCount, and isClean.
