NCubeName,NameType,0,n,"A name for the NCube. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:logicalproduct:3_3,e,
Label,LabelType,0,n,"A display label for the NCube. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
Description,StructuredStringType,0,1,A description of the content and structure of the NCube. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
UniverseReference,Universe,0,n,"Reference to the universe statement containing a description of the persons or other elements that this NCube refers to, and to which any analytic results refer. If more than one universe is referenced the universe of the variable is the intersect of the referenced universes.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
ImputationReference,ProcessingInstruction,0,1,Reference to an imputation process described as a GeneralInstruction or GenerationInstruction held in a ProcessingInstructionScheme.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:logicalproduct:3_3,e,
SourceUnit,CodeValueType,0,1,"The normal source of the information contained in the NCube. In the case of a survey this may be a respondent, proxy, interviewer, or other source. In the case of administrative data the position of a field on a form e.g., ""top of page"", ""item 3"", ""generated by data processor"", etc. Supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:logicalproduct:3_3,e,
AnalysisUnit,CodeValueType,0,1,"The entity to which the data refer, for example, individuals, families or households, groups, institutions/organizations, administrative units, etc. Supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary. The DDI Alliance has provided a controlled vocabulary (AnalysisUnit) to support this element at http://www.ddialliance.org/controlled-vocabularies.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
Purpose,StructuredStringType,0,1,"Purpose for which the NCube was created. For example, designed to support a set of age pyramids generated yearly. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
Dimension,DimensionType,0,n,"NCubes are defined by their dimensions. A dimension is provided a rank and a reference to a variable that describes it. Cell locations are ""addressed"" by the value of their intersect on each dimension provided in rank order.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:logicalproduct:3_3,e,
CoordinateRegion,CoordinateRegionType,0,n,Defines the area of attachment for an attribute. It may be defined as the NCube as a whole or as certain dimensions or values of dimensions.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:logicalproduct:3_3,e,
MeasureDefinition,MeasureDefinitionType,0,n,"Defines the structure and type of measure captured within the cells. This may be repeated to describe multiple measure for the cells (i.e., count, percent of universe, dimensional percent, index, text, suppression flag, etc.).",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:logicalproduct:3_3,e,
Attribute,AttributeType,0,n,An attribute may be any object which should be attached to all or part of the NCube. It may be defined as a Variable or contain textual content (such as a footnote).,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:logicalproduct:3_3,e,
DimensionCount,nonNegativeInteger,0,1,"The number of dimensions found in the NCube. Caution in using optional checksums is recommended. Conflict between checksums and the items being counted can cause problems with warning flags during processing. If using checksum to capture information for internal processing purposes, the use of automatically generated check sums is strongly urged.",,,,,,,,,,,,a,
CellCount,nonNegativeInteger,0,1,"The number of cells (measures) found in the NCube. Note that this is the number of cells produced by dimension structure not the number of cells containing data in a sparse NCube. Caution in using optional checksums is recommended. Conflict between checksums and the items being counted can cause problems with warning flags during processing. If using checksum to capture information for internal processing purposes, the use of automatically generated check sums is strongly urged.",,,,,,,,,,,,a,
IsClean,boolean,0,1,"A value of ""true"" indicates that all cells have the potential for content values. If set to ""false"" Attribute and CoordinateRegion should be used to define the sparse areas of the NCube, those that have no content by definition. For example a cross-tabulation between Household Type (Family, Non-Family) and Number of persons in Household (1,2,3,4,5,6,7+) would need an attribute for Family/1 Person as this will always be empty due to the definition of Family as two or more related persons.",,,,,,,,,,,,a,
