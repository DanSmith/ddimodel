A sub-universe group provides a definition to the universes contained within it. For example the Sub-Universe Group of Gender for the Universe Resident Population may contain the Universe Males and the Universe Females. In addition to the standard name, label, and description, the SubUniverseClass references a concept which defines it, and references to the universes and or other sub-universe groups it contains. The contents of the SubUniverseClass may be designated as ordered.
