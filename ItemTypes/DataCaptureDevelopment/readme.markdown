Data capture development covers the development planning, process, and outcome for a partial or full questionnaire. Development normally included the development of the question wording, possible response domains and their presentation, translation for language or cultural variance in the population, and question order. Extensive work is often done for individual questions that may be reused by different questionnaires with the organization or for topical areas or populations that are difficult to measure. In addition to the standard name, label, and description information DataCaptureDevelopment contains structures to capture the development plan, the development implementation, and the results or outcome of the development implementation. DataCaptureDevelopment is a Maintainable object and any Note or OtherMaterial related to one of its objects should be placed within the Note and OtherMaterial section of DataCaptureDevelopment.
