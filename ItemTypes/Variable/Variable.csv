Label,LabelType,0,n,"A display label for the Variable. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
Description,StructuredStringType,0,1,A description of the content and purpose of the Variable. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
OutParameter,ParameterType,0,1,Assigns a parameter that contains output from the Variable so that it can be bound to an InParameter of an instruction or act as the SourceParameter of another Variable.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
SourceParameterReference,ParameterType,0,1,Reference to an OutParameter that serves as the source for the content of this variable.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
SourceVariableReference,Variable,0,n,"Reference to variable(s) used as a basis for recoding, derivation, or other means of calculating the data for this variable. This reference is intended to provide basic information on the source variable structure including value representation, measurement unit, etc. Note that if a variable is used by reference within multiple VariableSchemes you can identify its role within a specific VariableScheme by including that VariableScheme in the sourceContext attribute of the reference. Use ProcessingInstructionReference to provide additional information on the transformation of the source variable(s) into the data for this variable. If additional processing detail is required use the InParameter, OutParameter, and ParameterLinkage options in the GenerationInstruction and ProcessingInstructionReference.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
RepresentedVariableReference,RepresentedVariable,0,1,"Reference to the RepresentedVariable that describes the core of this variable (the RepresentedVariable that the variable is the implementation of). The RepresentedVariable contains the broad reusable specification of the Variable, i.e., concept, universe, and value representation. These may be constrained by specifications within the Variable description. TypeOfObject should be set to RepresentedVariable.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
ConceptualVariableReference,ConceptualVariable,0,1,Reference to the ConceptualVariable that describes the core of this variable. The ConceptualVariable provides linked Concept and Universe specifications. These may be constrained by specifications within the Variable description. TypeOfObject should be set to ConceptualVariable.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
WeightingProcessReference,Weighting,0,1,When isWeight is set to true provide a reference to the Weighting process description used to generate this value. TypeOfObject will be Weighting,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:logicalproduct:3_3,e,
UniverseReference,Universe,0,n,"Reference to the universe statement containing a description of the persons or other elements that this variable refers to, and to which any analytic results refer. If more than one universe is referenced the universe of the variable is the intersect of the referenced universes.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
ConceptReference,Concept,0,1,Reference to the concept measured by this variable.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
QuestionReference,Question,0,n,"Reference to question(s) used to collect data for this variable. This references the wording and response domain of the question, not the question flow (if the same question was asked in reference to multiple objects (i.e., Age of each child). Use SourceParameterReference and/or VariableRepresentation/ProcessingInstructionReference to differentiate sources associated with flow patterns or data processing instructions.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
MeasurementReference,MeasurementItem,0,n,Reference to measurement(s) used to collect data for this variable.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
EmbargoReference,EmbargoType,0,1,Reference to any embargoes placed on the contents of this variable. Embargoes may limit access to the data and/or metadata to specific groups and/or for specified periods of time.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:logicalproduct:3_3,e,
SourceUnit,CodeValueType,0,1,"The normal source of the information contained in the variable. In the case of a survey this may be a respondent, proxy, interviewer, or other source. In the case of administrative data the position of a field on a form e.g., ""top of page"", ""item 3"", ""generated by data processor"", etc. Supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:logicalproduct:3_3,e,
AnalysisUnit,CodeValueType,0,1,"The entity to which the data refer, for example, individuals, families or households, groups, institutions/organizations, administrative units, etc. Supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary. The DDI Alliance has provided a controlled vocabulary (AnalysisUnit) to support this element at http://www.ddialliance.org/controlled-vocabularies.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
UnitTypeReference,UnitType,0,1,"Reference to the unit type containing a description of the unit type that this Variable refers to, and to which any analytic results refer. TypeOfObject should be set to UnitType.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
VariableRepresentation,VariableRepresentationType,0,1,"Describes the representation of the variable in the data set, including allowed content, data typing, and computation information.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:logicalproduct:3_3,e,
IsTemporal,boolean,0,1,"Set to ""true"" if the variable relays time-related information (date, time, season, relative time, etc.).",,,,,,,,,,,,a,
IsGeographic,boolean,0,1,"Set to ""true"" if the variable relays geographic information, i.e., geographic code, area name, relative location, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,a,
IsWeight,boolean,0,1,"Set to ""true"" if the variable is used a weight when analyzing data within the data set. If set to true provide a reference to the Applied Usage of the appropriate Processing Event Weight using WeightingAppliedUsage.",,,,,,,,,,,,a,
