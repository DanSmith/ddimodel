SourceRepresentation,SourceRepresentationType,0,1,"Provides a reference to the managed content of a representation which acts as the source object in the Source/Target comparison pair. May be a ManagedRepresentation or a specific CategoryScheme, CodeList, GeographicRepresentation, or GeographicLocation. Allows for the optional reference to a Concept when context is important. For example, a ManagedNumericRepresentation within the context of Age.",,,,,,,,,ddi:comparative:3_2,e,
TargetRepresentation,TargetRepresentationType,0,1,"Provides a reference to the managed content of a representation which acts as the target object in the Source/Target comparison pair.
