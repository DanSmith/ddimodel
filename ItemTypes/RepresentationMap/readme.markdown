Maps between any two managed representations. In addition to representation types held in a ManagagedRepresentationScheme, managed representations include CategoryScheme and coded representations which include CodeList, GeographicStructureCode or GeographicLocationCode. Note that the source can be any managed representation including a CodeList, GeographicStructure or GeographicLocation. Note that comparisons between two category schemes is best handled by CategoryMap. In addition to the standard name, label, and description of the RepresentationMap, identifies the source representation and target representation (which should be a CodeList, GeographicStructure, or GeographicLocation), describes the correspondence between the source and target, allows for the use of a GenerationInstruction to describe the recoding process, and indicates if this a general mapping or a mapping for a specific purpose.
