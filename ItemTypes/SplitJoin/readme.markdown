A member of the ControlConstruct substitution group. The components of a SplitJoin consists of a number of process steps to be executed concurrently with partial synchronization. SplitJoin consists of process steps that are executed concurrently (execution with barrier synchronization). That is, SplitJoin completes when all of its components processes have completed. Supports parallel processing that requires completion of all included process steps to exit.
