Provides the content and description of a single instruction. In addition to the standard name, label, and description, an InParameter can be designated to specify information needed to process the dynamic content of the instruction, an image can be associated with the instruction, and the instruction text provided using DynamicText. Note that when using Dynamic Text, the full InstructionText must be repeated for multi-language versions of the content. Different languages may handle the dynamic portions in different locations and/or with different content. Therefore languages cannot be mixed within a dynamic text except when the full text itself has multiple language sections, for example, a foreign language term in a text. The InstructionText may also be repeated to provide a dynamic and plain text version of the instruction. This allows for accurate rendering of the instruction in a non-dynamic environment like print.
