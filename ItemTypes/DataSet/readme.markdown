DataSet is a substitution for a BaseRecordLayout and allows for in-line inclusion of micro or unit level data in the metadata file. This is valuable for small datasets or cases where there is a need to combine the metadata and data within a single file. In addition to the PhysicalStructureReference the DataSet indicates the ArrayBase if applicable, a name for the DataSet, a reference to the default Variable Scheme used by the data set, a reference to an Identifying Variable (e.g. case number), and a choice of organization order for the data: Record Set, Item Set, or Variable Set. RecordSet describes records of data which contain the same variables in the same order, ItemSet describes individual items of a dataset in any order. VariableSet describes the values for a given variable in record order.
