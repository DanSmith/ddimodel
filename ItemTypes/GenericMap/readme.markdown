Maps the content of two different schemes of objects of the same type providing detail for the comparable items within those two schemes. Note that comparisons can be made between multiple items in the same scheme or two versions of the same scheme. In addition to the standard name, label, and description of the map, identifies the source scheme and target scheme containing those objects, describes the correspondence between the source and target schemes, and provides detailed comparison of the items within those two schemes.
