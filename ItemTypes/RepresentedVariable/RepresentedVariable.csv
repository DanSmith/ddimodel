RepresentedVariableName,NameType,0,n,"A name for the RepresentedVariable. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.",,,,,,,,,ddi:logicalproduct:3_2,e,
Label,LabelType,0,n,"A display label for the RepresentedVariable. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.",,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_2,e,
Description,StructuredStringType,0,1,A description of the RepresentedVariable. May be expressed in multiple languages and supports the use of structured content.,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_2,e,
ConceptualVariableReference,ConceptualVariable,0,1,A reference to a ConceptualVariable which provides the linkage to the Universe and Concept used by this RepresentedVariable. TypeOfObject should be set to ConceptualVariable.,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_2,e,
UniverseReference,Universe,0,1,"Reference to the universe statement containing a description of the widest possible group of persons or other elements that this RepresentedVariable refers to, and to which any analytic results refer. TypeOfObject should be set to Universe.",,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_2,e,
ConceptReference,Concept,0,1,Reference to the concept measured by this RepresentedVariable. TypeOfObject should be set to Concept.,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_2,e,
CategorySchemeReference,CategoryScheme,0,1,Reference to a category scheme that contains the representation domain of the RepresentedVariable. Use this element when only the category specifications are provided. If both a code and the related category must be specified use CodeRepresentation (member of the substitution group ValueRepresentation). TypeOfObject should be set to CategoryScheme.,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_2,e,
ValueRepresentation,RepresentationType,0,1,"Describes the actual representation of the RepresentedVariables' values. ValueRepresentation is the head of a substitution group which supports a number of representation types, i.e. CodeRepresentation, NumericRepresentation, TextRepresentation, DateTimeRepresentation, ScaleRepresentation, GeographicStructureCodeRepresentation, and GeographicLocationCodeRepresentation. Although the structure allows for specification of missing values these features should be used with caution. Like the definition of the universe and concept, the specification of the representation can be constrained by the Variable (the GSIM ImplementedVariable), for example a NumericRepresentation could be constrained with a lower top coding specification. Missing Values can be assigned separately by the Variable without impact on the ValueRepresentation of the specified valid values provided here.",,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_2,e,
ValueRepresentationReference_ManagedMissingValuesRepresentation,ManagedMissingValuesRepresentation,0,1,"Allows for the use of managed value representations by reference. ValueRepresentationReference is the head of a substitution group which supports a number of representation types not managed within existing schemes, i.e. ManagedNumericRepresentation, ManagedTextRepresentation, ManagedDateTimeRepresentation, and ManagedScaleRepresentation. TypeOfObject should be set to ManagedNumericRepresentation, ManagedTextRepresentation, ManagedDateTimeRepresentation, or ManagedScaleRepresentation.",,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_2,e,
