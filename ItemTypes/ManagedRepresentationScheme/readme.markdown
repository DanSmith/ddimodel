This scheme contains sets of values described by ManagedRepresentation. These are used by reference to define Variable Representation and Question Response Domain. Text representations cover all non-code and non-category representations/response domains that should be treated or analyzed as characters regardless of whether the character is a number or a letter. In addition to the name, label and description of the scheme, the structure allows for the inclusion on an external scheme by reference, definitions of ManagedRepresentations in-line or by reference, and ManagedRepresentationGroups in-line or by reference.
