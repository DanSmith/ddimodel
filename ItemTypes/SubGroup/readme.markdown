The subgroup element is a container for a group that is a child of a higher-level group described in this module, but may also be a parent to other (subordinate) groups. A studyunit can be fully described, or just referenced, within its subgroup container. The purpose of sub-groups is described using the attributes which summarize relationships along the dimensions of time, panel, geography, instrument and language. These attributes allow the purpose to be machine-actionable, while the sub-group also includes an element for describing the purpose in human-readable format. A SubGroup contains a Citation, Abstract, information on authorization, the universe of the sub-group, series statement, quality statements, funding information, purpose, coverage, analysis units covered, kind of data, other materials, and embargo information. It then allows all maintainable structures within the StudyUnit to be expressed at the SubGroup level.
