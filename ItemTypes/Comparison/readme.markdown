A maintainable module containing maps between objects of the same or similar type. Maps allow for pair-wise mapping of two objects by describing their similarities and differences in order to make assertions regarding their comparability. Currently maps allow for the comparison of concepts, variables, questions, categories, universes, and representations that have managed content (code, category, numeric, text, datetime and scale). These mapping(s) inform users on the comparability of two objects and facilitate automation. Note that all maps are pairwise, identifying two schemes and the correlation between two items in those schemes. Due to the complexity of some objects, multiple mappings may be required to cover details of the comparison of component parts, e.g. a QuestionMap may also have a related RepresentationMap. By using a set of pairwise comparisons, it is possible to describe complex correspondences - pairwise comparisons are easier to process. In addition to providing a standard name, label, and description, Comparison consists of a simple stack of comparison maps. Comparison maps are currently limited to those objects that can be referenced and are sufficiently structured to support a clear comparison.
