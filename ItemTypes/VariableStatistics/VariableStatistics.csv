VariableReference,Variable,0,1,Reference to the variable to which the statistics apply.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
TotalResponses,nonNegativeInteger,0,1,The total number of responses to this variable. This element is especially useful if the number of responses does not match added case counts. It may also be used to sum the frequencies for variable categories.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:physicalinstance:3_3,e,
