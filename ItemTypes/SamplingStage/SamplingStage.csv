TypeOfSequence,CodeValueType,0,n,"Provides the ability to ""type"" a sequence for classification or processing purposes. Supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
ControlConstructReference,ControlConstruct,0,n,References control constructs in the order that they should appear within the instrument.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
ConstructSequence,SpecificSequenceType,0,1,Describes alternate ordering for different cases using the SpecificSequence structure. If you set the sequence to anything other than order of appearance the only allowable children are QuestionConstruct or Sequence. Contents must be randomizable.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
FrameRequirements,StructuredStringType,0,1,"Describes the minimum requirements of the frame needed to use this sample stage. For example, if a stratification by age is specified in the stage the sample frame would need to support this stratification.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
RecommendedSampleFrameReference,SampleFrame,0,n,Identifies a specific sample frame or frames appropriate for this plan.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
Stratification,StratificationType,0,n,"A distinct ""strata"" within a population used to define a group to be sampled within that population, for example an Income Level or Postal Code.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
SamplingUnitReference,UnitType,0,1,Sampling unit for this stage,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
SelectionProbability,StructuredStringType,0,1,"If known and available, provide the selection probability for each sampling unit.  This is one number for equal probability sampling, such as SRS.  For PPS, a description of the size criterion is needed.  For other unequal designs, a description of of how the probabilities are assigned is needed.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
