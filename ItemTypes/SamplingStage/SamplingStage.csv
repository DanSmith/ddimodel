FrameRequirements,StructuredStringType,0,1,"Describes the minimum requirements of the frame needed to use this sample stage. For example, if a stratification by age is specified in the stage the sample frame would need to support this stratification.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
RecommendedFrameReference,SampleFrame,0,n,Identifies a specific sample frame or frames appropriate for this plan.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
Stratification,StratificationType,0,n,Describe all stratifications here. Note that each stratified group will be sampled using the same sampling plan. For example stratifying a state by ZIP Code areas in each of 5 mean income quintiles and then doing a random sample of the households in set of ZIP Codes. Allows for oversampling of identified subpopulations.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
SamplingUnit,UnitType,0,1,Sampling unit for this stage,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
SelectionProbability,StructuredStringType,0,1,"If known and available, provide the selection probability for each sampling unit.  This is one number for equal probability sampling, such as SRS.  For PPS, a description of the size criterion is needed.  For other unequal designs, a description of of how the probabilities are assigned is needed.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
ControlConstructReference,ControlConstruct,0,n,References control constructs in the order that they should appear within the instrument. Normally these consist of SampleSteps but may require routing information.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
